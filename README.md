# GNSH Annual Report Dashboard (2024)

## Overview
This Power BI dashboard was created to analyze meal service data from Good Neighbor Settlement Houseâ€™s Soup Kitchen and Respite Program. In 2024, Good Neighborhood Settlement House (GNSH) continued their vital mission to support low income households and the broader Brownsville community through its essential programs. This report focuses on two vital services: the soup kitchen and the respite program.

From January through September 2024, GNSH served a substantial amount of meals across both programs which demonstrates a consistent community reliance and operational commitment. The Soup Kitchen operates Monday-Friday, offering three meals per day while the Respite program provided those seeking asylum with meals and basic necessities.

Other than provide basic necessities such as food and shelter, there are a variety of other services that GNSH provides such as outreach and support services, a medical clinic, office services, etc. this is all in an effort to create a legacy of positive change for the city of Brownsville and to empower individuals by giving them a welcoming environment where they can be treated with respect, compassion, and opportunities to grow.

## Total Services Provided by GNSH

- 121,836 Respite Provided
- 52,394 Meal Served
- 1,618 Youth Assisted

**Key Insights:**
- Meal service volume increased by 12% in August and September, indicating seasonal spike possibly due to reflection of summer break for schools and back to school season. 
- Considerable difference between total amount of respite offered and meals served throughout the day. Most apparent after February 2024 and ratio decreases by 50% from March-July 2024.
- Meals served throughout the week are relatively consistent with Monday having the lowest amount due to low breakfast count. 


## Conclusion and Recommendations

- Keep accurate counts at each mealtime of how many people are actually present who are seeking respite. This should give a clearer understanding of how many people are there momentarily, for the day, and more importantly what times people tend to arrive seeking respite. This should help with staffing and stocking of needed items.

- Adjust how meals are prepared for breakfast throughout the week. Mondays should have the least amount of breakfast made as they tend to serve less on that day, followed by Wednesday and Thursday, as they average roughly 80 meals for breakfast.

- For months May-July there were a big drop in respite and meals. Adjust the number of staff working as you can expect a slower pace during these three months.

- Children presence tends to be relatively high during the time that school is in session. It would be good idea to identify whether kids are there to study, participate in extra curricular activities, or need supervision. This can help meet staffing needs by hiring people to perform the appropriate duties. Please note that children attendance tends to drop after April, possibly due to the completion of state testing, but picks up again in July which is right before school starts up again.
